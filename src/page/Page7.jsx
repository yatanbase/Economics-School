      <p className="text-justify">The PSE thrusts on quality teaching at the post-graduate level, and analytical and policy-oriented research at the doctoral and post-doctoral levels.<br></br><br></br>

The course curricula for the M.A. in Economics and the Ph.D. programmes of PSE are advanced and up-to-date. While the students of PSE are comprehensively exposed to recent theoretical developments in different areas of economics, efforts are also made to enhance their quantitative skills by providing hands-on training towards application of various statistical and econometric software packages for analysis and interpretation of socio-economic data.<br></br><br></br>

The PSE keeps contact with the leading experts in the field of economics who are invited as guest/visiting faculties to take part in the teaching programmes alongside its own faculties. This facilitates academic interactions of its faculties and students with the experts from other institutions<br></br><br></br>

The students of the PSE are provided an education and academic training that are as rigorous as practiced in the best Institutions in India and abroad.<br></br><br></br>

The PSE promotes a value system whereby each member of the PSE community is motivated to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of the humankind.</p>
